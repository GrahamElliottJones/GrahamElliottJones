Hello There! My name is Graham Jones and I am currently a college student studying mechanical engineering and computer science, hoping to get a bachelors in both!

Coding is a skill I have been building up for a while now, and I have experiences with: Python, C#, Web Development (HTML, CSS, Javascript), Visual Basic, and the Windows .net Framework.
I don't know every language, but I do understand the basic structures of many languages, and can pick up new ones within a fairly short period.
I also work with Raspberry Pis to try and increase my skills (and make cool projects in the meantime).

My hobbies include: DJing, archery, creating cosplay/costumes for characters, TTRPGs, designing robots, and anything space related. And that's only a small taste!
Thanks for checking me out!
